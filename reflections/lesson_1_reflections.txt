How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By isolating the lines that were different in the two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I would be able to easily find file modifications and bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The manual option allows me to create a commit in a stable/consistent state.
		The automatic option is more secure, as I cannot "forget" to commit my changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git was created to manage projects that are built on multiple files, and
		the state of the project gets frozen by a commit that save all of them.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the identifiers and the commit messages of different commits, 
		while git diff allows us to compare the files in two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I will always have a consistent state of the system (a commit) to revert 
		the project to in case i screw up the code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Don't know, man!
